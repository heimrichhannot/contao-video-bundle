### Setup

1. Setup the [configuration](https://docs.contao.org/manual/de/system/einstellungen/#config-yml) to your likes (see [configuration reference](docs/configuration.md) for all options):

    ```yaml
    huh_video:
        # Enable support for news entity.
        enable_news_support:    false
        # Enable if by default no cookie embed urls should be used, if supported by the video provider. This can be overwritten on root pages.
        default_use_no_cookie_video_url: false
        # Enable if by default a privacy message should be displayed before playing the video. This can be overwritten on root pages.
        default_display_privacy_notice: false
    ```
1. Clear cache and check for database updates after update your config
1. Adjust template settings on root page if needed. You can also overwrite the default configuration there.
    * If privacy center bundle installed, configure the integration there.

1. Start adding videos as content element or to your news.
    * Content Element: Select "Video" content element
    * News:
        * Check "Add video" in your news item
        * output "videoplayer" variable in your news template
